# MasterFRCScouter
A new FRC Scouting Android App that allows for FRC Scouting.
The original version (1.0 Alpha) was built by one person (Adi) in the three days leading up to the 2015 Indiana Robotics Invitational (2015IRI)!

Note: In order to correctly build this app, you must make a Class called APIKeys, and add a "TWITTER_KEY" and "TWITTER_SECRET" Strings with Twitter API info (used for Fabric.io).

## TO-DO
* Add Java Docs
* Simplify the UI
* Modularity
* Cleanup
* Unit Tests
* Material UI
* Launch the app to the Play Store
* Update the App and TBA API for 2016 and future games
